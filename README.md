This is a project by [University of Virginia Claude Moore Health Sciences Library](https://guides.hsl.virginia.edu/home) staff members Lucy Carr Jones, Anson Parker, and Abbey Heflin to study the publication patterns of UVA Health authors. We are using open data from [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService) and visualizing it with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/sharing). 

More details about the process can be found [here](https://guides.hsl.virginia.edu/it-services-blog/zoombites/Open-publishing-and-citation-dashboard-with-EuropePMC-data-in-Python-and-) and [here](https://guides.hsl.virginia.edu/it-services-blog/zoombites/Exploratory-data-analysis-with-streamlit-sweetviz-and-pandas-profiling).

For questions about our development process, please contact Anson Parker at adp6j@virginia.edu and for questions about data sources or research, please contact Lucy Carr Jones at lgc3t@virginia.edu.
